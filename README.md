# Breast-Cancer-Classificationwith-False-Negatives
Comparative analysis of four machine learning models for breast cancer classification, emphasizing accuracy and false negative detection.
# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign based on medical data. The aim is to compare model performance and reduce false negative predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features related to tumor characteristics such as radius, texture, smoothness, and symmetry.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  

## How It Works
The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.  
Different machine learning models are trained and evaluated to compare accuracy and false negatives.

## Results
Model performance is measured using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Conclusion
The project shows that machine learning can assist in early detection of breast cancer by classifying tumors effectively.
